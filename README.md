Gen 575: Fundamentals of Biomedical Instrumentation

# Course description
An introduction to the fundamentals of instrumentation commonly used in biomedical research settings including mass spectrometers, optical microscopes, and DNA sequencers. Emphasis on a practical understanding of the physical and chemical properties that underlie operation and sources of uncertainty, noise, and error. 

# Instructional staff
Michael MacCoss, PhD \
Brian Beliveau, PhD

# Meeting times and locations
_Spring Quarter 2022_: Mondays & Wednesdays 10:30â€“11:50 am, Foege S-110

# Prerequisites
Background in molecular and cellular biology, chemistry, genetics, biochemistry, engineering, or related discipline and experience with quantitative problem solving.

# Course materials
There is no one textbook that can effectively cover the information presented in this course. To supplement the lecture content, the instructors will assign supplemental readings from reviews, historical papers, and/or free online sources.

# Course requirements
Late homework will be accepted, but penalized. Specifically, each assignment is worth 100 points, from which 10 points will be deducted for each day (or fraction thereof) that you turn it in late. The maximum deduction for being late is 60 points (even if you are more than 6 days late).

# Course grade
Participation: 40% \
Problem sets: 60% (6, worth 10% each).

# Course format
Each 80-minute class will be divided between lecture content about an instrumentation topic, discussion, and problem solving exercises related to the lecture topic.
